# Song_genre_Classification
This project classifies songs into genres using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on audio features. It utilizes datasets such as GTZAN and this model architecture includes several convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by dense layers. Results show the effectiveness of CNNs in music genre classification.
